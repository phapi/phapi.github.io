## Contributing
There are many ways to contribute to the Phapi Framework.

- Bug reports and fixes are [always welcome](https://github.com/phapi/phapi-framework/issues/new) as well as feature, cache provider, middleware and serializer requests. Take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/phapi/phapi-framework/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) for open issues and join the discussion if you want to help.

You can also help out by implementing

 - [Cache providers](/docs/implement/cache/)
 - [Middleware](/docs/implement/middleware/)
 - [Serializers](/docs/implement/serializers/)

Take a look at the lists of existing [Cache providers](/docs/cache/introduction/), [Middleware](/docs/middleware/introduction/) and [Serializers](/docs/serializers/introduction/) before you start implementing your own packages. Ask around to find out if someone else already started working on a similar package. If a project already exists and you feel that you can contribute, talk to the developers on that specific project.

## Contributor Guidelines
All developers has their own style of how we code, thats why the Phapi Framework has contributor guidelines. These ensure that we all follow the same rules and the same code style.

### Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
