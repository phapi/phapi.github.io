      <h4>Hello API! in the matter of minutes</h4>
      <p>Have your first endpoint <a href="/docs/started/installation/">up and running</a> in the matter of minutes. Phapi comes with a <a href="/docs/started/installation/">basic configuration</a> that works out of the box. It even includes an Hello API example with your first endpoint and route.</p>

    <div class="col-md-5">
      <h4>Add new features without modifying your endpoints</h4>
      Phapi is based on <a href="/docs/middleware/introduction/">middleware</a>. That makes it really easy to add new features while you build your API. You will propably realize that you need more features as you go. Maybe you need rate limiting, add a middleware! Do you need to support CORS?, add a middleware!

      <h4>Focus on endpoints, Phapi takes care of the rest</h4>
      <p>Phapi is built so that you can focus on what you know best, how your endpoints should work. Phapi takes care of the rest including (de)serialization, content negotitation and error handling.</p>
